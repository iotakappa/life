# life

This simple curses implementation of Conway's Game of Life is my "hello world" for python and github.

This version is just the basic engine.  Future versions will hopefully include:
1. An in place starting pattern editor.
2. Load and save starting pattern dialogues.
3. An optimised generation engine.
4. Graphical rather than curses output.
5. Realtime controls such as pause / play, slower / faster, load and save etc.

The point of all this is simply for me to exercise different aspects of python.
