# life

This simple curses implementation of Conway's Game of Life is my "hello world" for python and github.

This version is just the basic engine.  Future versions will hopefully include:
1. An in place starting pattern editor.
2. Load and save starting pattern dialogues.
3. An optimised generation engine.
4. Graphical rather than curses output.

The point of all this is simply for me to exercise different aspects of python.
